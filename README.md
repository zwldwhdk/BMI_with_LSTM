# BMI_with_LSTM
Brain Machine Interface with Deep Neural Network, Long Short Term Memeory

# Datasets
Non-invasive Brain signal data; especially EEG or MEG
For this cords, I used 306 channels MEG data(204 gradiometers out of whole channel exactly) which was collected from Yeom et al., (2012) experiment.

# Decoder
*I uploaded 3 decoder types for MEG signal decoding.
1) single-layered bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory(bLSTM)
2) 3 layered Convolution Neural Network
3) RCNN; 3-layered CNN + single-layer bLSTM
